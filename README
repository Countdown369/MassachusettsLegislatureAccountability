This dashboard is in its early stages - as of 08/22/22, this is the first fully working prototype which can both scrape the current data on representatives and tabulate it into the two output files:

GeneralCourtCommitteeAppointments: Lists Chairs, Vice Chairs, and Members by committee.
COMDATA: Lists data by representative (e.g. district, party, number of positions held, which positions are held).

The script which accomplishes this is currently the only .py file in the repo:

waysandmeans.py: Uses an UNVERIFIED SSL CONTEXT (be extremely careful if you care about security!) to scrape data from malegislature.gov and tabulate it into output files.

Look forward to updates and please contact me if you've any questions or are interested into turning this data into an *online* dashboard.
